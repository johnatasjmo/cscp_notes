#### Strategy: demand driven

Based on Pull systems: 1. Production based on demand, 2. Material as demand, not issue until sign comes from user, 3. In distribution, system for replenishment are made at the field warehouse, not at a central warehouse

#### Cost structure

- **Make to stock:** low production cost, high inventory carring cost. Standarized, high-volume products
- **Assemble to order:** modules are made to stock but final customer order is asembled only after being ordered. Moderate production cost and low inventory carrying and planning. High demand items with many options as computers
- **Make to order:** high production cost but low inventory carryng cost and low planning cost. Sporadic demand patterns and wide configuration options
- **Configure to order:** mass production items that can be configured after being ordered. Like an extension of make-to-order has moderate production and inventory carrying cost. It is used when customer is willing to wait
