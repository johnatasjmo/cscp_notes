# Fulfillment Strategies Considering Market Requirements

### Balancing efficiency with responsiveness

Responsiveness implies being responsive to changing customer requirements (investing in high customer service and/or agility). 

The variables that differentiate efficient and responsive supply chains are inventory volume and demand
uncertainty.

Efficient focus supply chain strives to have a combination of:

- Stable customer demand
- The number of forecasting errors is low
- Little or no adaptation to markets
- Long product life cycle
- Product introductions are infrequent
- There is limited product variety



A responsive supply chain has the following attributes:

- Customer demand is not stable and can fluctuate significantly
- The number of forecasting errors can be high.
- There is adaptation to changes in structures of markets.
- It uses real-time systems for customer data and purchases.
- There is a short product life cycle.
- It may use multiple warehouses for close proximity to customers.
- It may maintain extra or redundant capacity in the form of geographically diversified operations or
  contracts with suppliers.
- It may use third-party transportation providers for speedy product delivery.
- It may require its manufacturer(s) and suppliers to have a high degree of agility (ramping up or down
  without cost penalties).

Level of service is a measure (usually expressed as a percentage) of satisfying demand through inventory or by the
current production schedule in time to satisfy the customers’ requested delivery dates and quantities.

### Supply chain fit with organizations’ market requirements

Supply chain managers need to determine which type of supply chain is most appropriate for a particular

product.

### Making supply chains resilient

in order to develop or maintain a competitive edge, supply chains also need to become agile, adaptable, and aligned

with other entities in the supply chain.

*Supply chain resilience* is  “the ability of a supply chain to anticipate, create plans to avoid or mitigate, and/or to recover from disruptions to supply chain functionality.”

A company’s resilience is determined by its competitive position and its supply chain’s ability to be responsive to changes or disruptions.

They can increase their resilience by building in redundancy or flexibility. Redundancy can be created by establishing safety stock, using multiple suppliers (even when more expensive), and intentionally setting low capacity utilization rates. To increase an organization’s flexibility, mechanisms or indicators need to be put in place that can sense threats and react quickly and accordingly.
