# Supply Chain Network Optimization

Optimization often involves developing the capabilities to find and enact the least-cost solution for
the entire network (efficient or lean) or developing the ability to manage demand and respond to actual
demand (responsive) through some combination of customer focus and/or agility.

two techniques:

- Mathematical algorithms to determine least-cost or best solutions

- Simulation models to evaluate design alternatives

  

### Stages of supply chain network technology optimization

##### Stage 1: multiple dysfunction

##### Stage 2: semifunctional enterprise

##### Stage 3: integrated enterprise

##### Stage 4: extended enterprise



### Moving between optimization stages

##### Supply chain network optimization strategy

Strategy is set in several steps:

1. Determine the goals and the desired end state of the supply chain.

2. Create cross-functional and cross-business teams.

3. Organize the supply chain’s operational processes and IT’s mission.

4. Design in change management and training with stringent timetables for all parties. Measure results and provide feedback.

5. Create a conceptual model that will adequately explain the process and all of its elements.

6. Establish technical infrastructure.

Organizations wishing to form a strategy to get to the next stage first need teams to stay abreast of supply
chain technology developments. This thinking should include how the technology would benefit them if they
had it as well as if a competitor had it first. Second, organizations wishing to move to an inter-enterprise
strategy must build a wide and deep knowledge base of all members of the supply chain network. Third,
team-building training should stress a holistic viewpoint; that is, they should think of all members of the
supply chain as if they were all in the same lifeboat. When cross-functional teams come from different
nationalities and cultures, supply chain managers may need to educate team members to show proper
sensitivity to cultural differences. 



### Role of nucleus firm and cross-functional teams

Because the nucleus firm is most likely the best-known
name in the partnership or has its name on the products, it is ultimately responsible for customer satisfaction.

Common teams:

Executive team, 	technolog, buying, making, selling, inventory and delivery team.
