# Supply Chain Design and Configuration

### Translating strategy into design

*supply chain design* as the determination of how to structure a supply chain. Design decisions include the selection of partners,the location and capacity of warehouse and production facilities, the products, the modes of
transportation, and supporting information systems.

SCOR model -> the process is in the plan phase, when objectives are defined.

Strategic decisions:

- Customer and market decisions (reflect customer needs, i.e. Inditex with 2 different SC)
- Technology decision  (right technology by the right people)
  - How frequent data should be transfered
  - How data will be analyzed
  - Determine the impact of eCommerce
  - Design infrastructure between partners
  -  Integrating IT for a competitive strateg
- Process decisions and inventory, funds, and information flows
- Sourcing ( “the process of identifying a company that provides a needed good or service.”)

### Supply chain network design

- Information system architecture as A model of how the organization operates regarding information. The model considers four factors: (1) organizational functions, (2) communication of coordination requirements, (3) data modeling needs, and (4) management and control structures. The architecture of the information system should be aligned with and match the architecture of the organization.

- Organizational strategy

- Information strategy

- Information content definition

  - The appropriate number of facilities (warehouses, plants)

  - The size and location of each facility 
  - The allocation of space for products within the facility
  - Sourcing requirements
  - Distribution strategies.

- Information policies and controls (to be used in information infrastructure design, daily operations, and continual improvement initiatives)

- Information infrastructure design  (how to translate policies and controls into a cohesive

  and cost-effective information system that minimizes data duplication and errors, provides access to

  information at all necessary internal and external points, and supports effective analysis and efficient

  transaction processing.)

- Databases, networks, software, and configuration

- Information infrastructure change

- Information infrastructure change

### Network configuration

Supply chain network configuration is a complex strategic decision that concerns the comprehensive
organization of suppliers, production factories, distribution centers, and manufacturing resources.

- Location of plants and production levels for each product
- Number, location, and capacity of warehouses
- Transportation between all facilities.

### Metrics design

People are motivated to improve what the organization chooses to measure and to ignore or deprioritize what the organization fails
to measure.
