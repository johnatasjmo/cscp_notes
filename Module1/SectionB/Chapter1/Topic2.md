# Financial Modeling

Financial modeling involves determining the financial feasibility and return on investment (ROI) of a
product/service strategy or supply chain strategy.

Financial modeling has more nuance than just taking the benefits and dividing them by the costs, though this
is the basic formula for ROI.

*economic value added (EVA)*: “In managerial accounting, the net operating profit earned above the cost of capital for a profit center.” 

EVA is useful because it specifically accounts for the capital investment cost before it calculates profit.
