### The four Ps of marketing and demand shaping

**Demand shaping:** the practice of using the four Ps…and other market variables to influence the demand of a product or service so that the demand better matches the available supply.

#### Product

 For our purposes includes both products and services or product/service packages.

Value-added implications for a customer-focused program:
The product itself must be designed to fulfill customer expectations and pose few challenges for
customer use
*The product* must be manufactured or created to meet quality levels that satisfy customer expectations
and business profit margins.
**Promotion and distribution** must be customized as well to address the distinctive needs of a segmented
audience. The performance of the program must be tracked.
**Sales methods** may need to be customized and measured for effectiveness.
**Customer care personnel**  be familiar with what the individual customer has bought and the status
of the order without having to be told by the customer.

#### Price

Pricing is generally a strategic decision, based on competition, perceived value, and brand identity.

If the market is highly competitive and a product has become a commodity, price will be dictated by the competitive situation, but in a more differentiated marketplace, pricing becomes more subjective.

#### Placement

Placement has traditionally referred to the way in which a product is sold—how the product or service gets into the hands of the customer.
