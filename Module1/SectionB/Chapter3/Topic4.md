# Simplification

Simplification is “improving quality and cutting costs by removing complexity from a product or service”.

Simplification provides synergy with other design approaches such as
standardization or customization as well as with manufacturing approaches such as build-to-order.

Types:

### Concurrent engineering (CE)

Starts from the premise that the product design processes can be shortened and simplified when stakeholders other than the engineers contribute.

Benefits:

- design collaboration
- shorter design when events are parallel
- can interact in design via virtual meetings

Tradeoffs

- has been replaced by other methodologies

### Design for manufacture and assembly

a product development approach that involves the manufacturing function in the initial stages of product
design to ensure ease of manufacturing and assembly.

*Design for manufacturability* is the “simplification of parts, products, and processes to improve
quality and reduce manufacturing costs.”

Goals:

- To select materials for ease of production as well as product function
- To design components so that they do not require extremely tight tolerances
- To reduce the number of parts
- To reduce the number of instances parts need to be handled
- To use concurrent and parallel processing to reduce work-in-process time
- To make assembly obvious and easy
- To simplify the process steps for assembly
- To design in easy product testing

Benefits:

- Confusion, complexity, and variability are reduced,
- Standards and policies can enforce DFMA
- DFMA makes use of standarization
- Lean, modular design, mass customization
- Software automates

Tradeoffs

If a feature is ommited, wont meet customer or marketing requirements

### Design for service (design for maintainability)

Design for service is the “simplification of parts and processes to improve the after-sale service of a
product” (APICS Dictionary, 16th edition). It is also called design for maintainability.

Benefits

- Lowers the total cost of ownership
- Extends to logistics (i.e. ordering replacement parts)
