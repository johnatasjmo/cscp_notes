# Customization

Customization is a design goal that allows products or product families to be adapted to changing customer
demand over time.

Requires engineering-to-order has a very high product cost and long
lead times.

### Mass customization

Mass customization is the practice of moving final product configuration closer to the customer.
The use of mass production techniques to create large volume of products in a wide variety keeping
production costs low while enabling customized output primarily utilizing postponement or delayed
differentiation.

A classic example of mass customization is Hewlett Packardâ€™s decision to stop sending completely
assembled, regionally differentiated printers from one plant to all geographic markets and instead to ship
modular parts to each regional distributor for assembly closer to the customer.

##### Benefits

- Savings due to scale
- Increased efficiency and expertise of workers
- Increase of product sales
- Reduced inventory (to regional)
- Semiskilled jobs in the community

##### Tradeoffs

- cost of investing in equipment and training
- potential friction with distributors (additional tasks)
- Potential issue for quality in the last part of assembly

### Postponement

Postponement is a product design or supply chain strategy that deliberately delays final differentiation (i.e., assembly,
production, packaging, tagging, etc.) until the latest possible time in the process. This shifts product
differentiation closer to the consumer to reduce the anticipatory risk, eliminating excess inventory in the
form of finished goods in the supply chain.

Product differentiation as a strategy of making a product distinct from the competition on a nonprice basis such as availability, durability, quality, or reliability.

```
An example of this strategy is Dell Computers build-to-order online store. Dell has mastered the art of postponement for their custom-designed machines for individual consumers. When Dell started, this was not necessarily the case in the industry, however, Dell invented a new business model and leveraged postponement as a business model not as a supply chain strategy though, and it then designed their supply chain to support this business model.	
```

```
A successful example of Postponement strategy is the use of vanilla boxes. Semi-finished computers are stored in advance of seeing the actual demand for the finished products. Upon seeing the demand, thus with no residual uncertainty these vanilla boxes are finished by adding or removing components.

##### Benefits

- Reduces the need for safety stock in multiple varieties (against bullwip effect)
- In-transit inventory is reduced (lowering cost of handling)
- Some materials can be sourced locally

##### Tradeoffs

- Requires product, process, packagin expenses
- Can increase the cost if there are variations in the end

### Glocalization

When used in a supply chain context, glocalization is a form of postponement where a product or
service is developed for distribution globally but is modified to meet the needs of a local market. The
modifications are made to conform with local laws, customs, cultures or preferences.

Examples:

- fast foods with menus
- Yahoo with 25 different web portals
- MTV customize TV releases and language
- Unilever, one product, different taste per country (mayonneise)
