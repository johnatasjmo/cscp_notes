# Quality

Conformance to requirements or fitness for use. Quality can be defined through five principal
approaches: 

(1) Transcendent quality is an ideal, a condition of excellence. 

(2) Product-based quality is based on a product attribute. 

(3) User-based quality is fitness for use. 

(4) Manufacturing-based quality is conformance to requirements. 

(5) Value-based quality is the degree of excellence at an acceptable
price. 

Also, quality has two major components: 

(1) quality of conformance—quality is defined by the absence of defects, and 

(2) quality of design—quality is measured by the degree of customer satisfaction with a product’s characteristics and features.

### Design for quality

design for quality as a product design approach that uses quality measures to capture the extent to which the design meets the needs of the target market (customer attributes), as well as its actual performance, aesthetics, and
cost.

Benefits:

- fewer defects, better customer satisfaction
- can move organization strategy

### Design for sigma

an approach to designing products and processes that attempts to ensure the firm can provide products
or services that meet six sigma quality levels. These quality levels correspond to approximately 3.4
defects per million opportunities.





### Quality function deployment

Quality function deployment (QFD) is defined  as a methodology designed to ensure that all the major requirements of the customer are identified and subsequently met or exceeded through the resulting product design process and the design and operation of the supporting production management system.

Benefits

- Provides all of the benefits of design for quality
- Improves customer service
- Feature development can be balanced
