### Design for the environment

Design for the environment (DFE) requires “considering health, safety, and environmental aspects of a
product during the design and development phase of product development”.

DFE aims to create a product that lives and ends its life cycle economically, with the least damage to the customer, the company, and the environment.

- Provision for reuse or reclycling
- Reduced energy consumption
- Avoidance or mitigated danger of hazardous materials
- Use of lighter components and less material

##### Benefits

- Afects al phases of supply chain management
- Good reputation, goodwill
- Reduced corporate liability

##### Tradeoffs

- Increased manufacturing cost
- Reduced safety for small and light products
- Reduced longevity of natural products

```
It took years, but Intel finally hunted down all of the smelters used to produce all the minerals in its microprocessors. Now they’re all conflict-free, too. Most have been validated by third-party audits.

### Design for reverse logistics

The reverse chain handles products that need to be returned, repaired, replaced, or recycled. 

This might include ease of disassembly for repairs, an affordable warranty program, a box that can be
used for shipping and return, well-trained and accessible customer service personnel, and comprehensible
instructions—as well as a product designed to endure.

##### Benefits

- Increase customer loyalty
- Low cost of return
- Improved product design

##### Tradeoffs

A complex system, overcost can show up along the chain.

In some industry sectors, this disposition option has become a huge market in itself. For instance, the automobile industry sells a wide range of remanufactured automotive components, including engines, clutches, gearboxes, fuel injectors, and other products, in the automotive aftermarket. A remanufactured part may sell for around 50-75 percent of a comparable new one and carries the same warranty. However, the remanufactured parts must be labeled as "rebuilt" and be priced lower than the original part.9 For some companies, rebuilding is an integral part of their business strategy.

H&M accepts used clothing at all of their stores worldwide. The clothes can be any condition or brand, and H&M will use the clothing they’ve collected to create an all-recycled clothing line. This type of reverse logistics chain allows all types of consumers to get involved with the brand, even if they didn’t purchase their garment from H&M.

### Design for remanufacture

Design for remanufacture products developed in a manner that allows components to be used in other products. This 
associated with green manufacturing.

```
Xerox, for example, leases its copiers; at the end of the lease period, Xerox rebuilds and resells them.
```

##### Benefits

- Lower cost to the product
- Lower cost to the environment
- Lower product development cost

##### Tradeoffs

- Cash can be tight up longer as manufacturer receives parts back

[A Typology of Remanufacturing in Closed-Loop Supply Chains](https://ukdiss.com/examples/closed-loop-supply-chains.php)

```
Few firms have enough market control to prevent third-party remanufacturers from entering the market. Even Xerox, the exemplar firm of multiple lifecycle products, faces significant third-party competition. In fact, Xerox has taken a tact of co-opetition in many cases and provides the third-party players with access to coming design changes and part phase-outs to mitigate any damage the third-parties might cause to the Xerox brand name—a name that is prominently displayed on the product whether Xerox or a third-party completed the remanufacturing operations (Whitmyre 2011). In some cases, Xerox will even provide service contracts for machines remanufactured by third-parties to mitigate any potential brand damage from remanufacturing practices that do not meet with Xerox’s exacting standards.

Case study - Apple initiatives on reuse, recycling and zero waste
Material reuse: 
Apple demonstrated that most of the aluminium recovered from iPhones can be part of the 100%
recycled aluminium enclosure of a MacBook Air. Reaching deeper into its supply chain, Apple partnered with battery and final-assembly suppliers to also send Apple’s battery scrap to its recycler upstream. Now, recycled cobalt from both scrap sources is being recycled into the batteries of new Apple products – a truly circular supply chain.
