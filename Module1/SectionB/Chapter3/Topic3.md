# Standardization

*Standardization* is “the process of designing and altering products, parts, processes, and procedures to establish and use standard specifications for them and their components”

*standardized product,* which is “a product that can be made in large quantities, or continuously, because of very few product designs”

### Component commonality

where a single part is used to replace a variety of similar parts.

##### Benefits

- Common components can increase efficiency and lower costs
- Lower purchasing costs
- More streamlined production because of fewer shifts between 
- Simpler, cheaper storage

##### Tradeoffs

- Cost of product modifications required to accept the new part

- Less flexibility for designers

- Reductions in quality if the greater variety of parts would

### Modularization

*modularization* as In product development, the use of standardized parts for flexibility and variety. Permits product
development cost reductions by using the same item(s) to build a variety of finished goods.

*modular design strategy* is planning and designing products so that components or subassemblies can be used in current and future products or assembled to produce multiple configurations of a product.

The opposite of modularity is integral design.

##### Benefits

- Reduced cost of design and manufacturing with family of products

- Increased efficiency and decreased cost of production

- Expanded customer base, because products can be customized

- Easier, more cost-effective shipping, warehousing, and display of the product

##### Tradeoffs

- the cost of each product in a family may go up.

- Errors  can create a poor end user experience.

- Integral design generally allows more emphasis on style, beauty, quality, “fit and finish,”

### Universality

Universality is “the strategy of designing a product initially intended for one market in such a way that it can also be sold in other markets”

##### Benefits

- increased sales volume
- reduced design and manufacturing cost

##### Tradeoffs

On the debit side, universal designs may be less suited to any given market than a specialized product. So shorter product life cycle and less customer loyalty
