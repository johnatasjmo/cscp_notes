# Broad-based Design Methods

### Design for the supply chain

*Design for the supply chain* refers to “enhancement of a firm’s product design in consideration of the
issues that will arise in the supply chain, from raw materials to the final stage of the product’s life cycle”

### Design for logistics

product are designed simultaneously to optimize efficiency, affordability, and quality.

- Designing to minimize transportation and storage costs: efficient packaging for fast loading/unloading
  and higher density of items per pallet
- Designing to minimize manufacture and assembly time
- Designing to maximize standardization.

Benefits:

- Lowering transportation and warehousing costs increases profit margins.
- Warehouses can store more goods
- Recognizable master carton design helps retailers to restock from storerooms.
- Packaging design can allow some retailers to sell directly from a pallet.

Tradeoffs:

- maximizing for pallets against slow-moving goods required in less quantities
- product requirements might make standard boxes problematic
- density of items must be balanced between volume and weight vehicle

### Design for X (DFX)

*design for X (DFX):* also referred to as design for excellence, a design process that ensures the outcome is manufacturable, maintainable, cost effective, and high quality.
