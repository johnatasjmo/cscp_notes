# Macro- and Microeconomic Considerations



## Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is the analysis of the behavior of the overall economy (supply and demand in aggregate) in response to various market forces.

### Real GDP and weighted average price

Real gross domestic product is the total value of all final goods and services produced within a given set of economic boundaries such as a country’s national boundaries.

During the strong part of a growth phase, prices will be relatively low and total real GDP will be high,

The potential output of the area’s economy at full employment is also called the longrange aggregate supply.



### Interpreting macroeconomic information

Similarly, if a country’s net exports increase, aggregate demand increases, and vice versa. Export levels can
change due to changes in exchange rates (depreciated currencies increase aggregate exports and demand,
while appreciated currencies reduce them) or when other countries increase their GDP and have more
wealth to spend.

An increase in productivity relative to inputs will result in larger real GDP levels at any price. (On a curve
mapping short-term aggregate supply, the entire curve would shift to the right or toward higher real GDP
levels.) This could be

 due to a new technology or better-educated workers.



Inflation is a sustained increase in the general level of prices for an area, while deflation is a sustained
decrease in prices.

One way to detect inflation is with a consumer price index (CPI), which is a sampling of
the actual prices of various consumer goods. Inflation occurs when consumers have more money available
to spend but the supply is scarce.



### Recessions and depressions

A recession is when real GDP declines for two consecutive quarters. If the long-range aggregate supply decreases during that time or if the contraction is severe or prolonged, it becomes a depression.

### Metrics

the consumer confidence index (CCI)
provides leading information on likely future demand because it polls consumers’ feelings about the
economy and how likely they are to make purchases.

the producer price index (PPI). The PPI measures the prices received by domestic
producers for their goods and services, which can help indicate producers’ opinions of the economy. PPI can
also help when determining how to set contract terms.

In addition to GDP, the World Bank and other sources such as the International Monetary Fund and the
World Trade Organization publish economic indicators such as gross national income; government
surpluses, deficits, and indebtedness; consumer savings; and foreign investment.

## Microeconomics

#### Supply and demand on a microeconomic scale

microeconomics as “the analysis of the behavior of
individual economic decision makers (individuals and firms).” Microeconomics focuses on specifics such as
the price of a product, how sensitive customers are to changes in that price (how much price changes impact
demand), cost trends for a business, or employment levels in a given industry.

***Law of demand.*** The law of demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, demand
will decrease (all things being equal).

the marketplace is diverse, and there are goods and services that might be almost as good as the desired scarce item. These are called substitute goods.

**Law of supply.** : The law of supply states that as the price of a good or service increases, supply will
also increase. More sellers can sell at a profit.

**Equilibrium.** Just as supply and demand on an aggregate scale tend toward equilibrium, so do
individual prices. The law of supply and demand states that the price of any good will adjust until the
quantity supplied and quantity demanded are in balance.

#### Price elasticity

price elasticity as The degree of change in buyer demand in response to changes in product price. It is calculated by
dividing the percentage of change in quantity bought by the percentage of change of price. Prices are
considered elastic if demand varies with changes in price. If demand changes only slightly when the
price changes, demand is said to be inelastic. For example, demand for most medical services is
relatively inelastic, but demand for automobiles is generally elastic.

#### Price elasticity of supply

Price elasticity of supply shows how sensitive suppliers are to changes in product price

Over the short term, suppliers will continue to supply products at lower prices, so they are inelastic in the short term, but over time they will shift away from these products to produce products with higher profit margins, so over the long
term, supply is elastic.

#### Marginal analysis

A marginal analysis focuses only on the marginal utility
and marginal cost of the choice. Marginal utility is the extra usefulness or satisfaction gained from
purchasing one additional unit of the good or service. Marginal cost is the additional cost incurred for making
a given decision or the cost of producing one more unit of a good or service.

The rule for marginal analysis is that if the marginal utility exceeds the
marginal cost, it is a wise economic choice.
