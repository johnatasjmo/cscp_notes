# Accounting and Financial Reporting Information

*Cost accounting* is the branch of accounting that is concerned with recording and reporting business operating costs. It includes the reporting of costs by departments, activities, and products.

*standard costs* are the target costs of an operation, process, or product including direct material, direct labor, and overhead charges.

*standard cost accounting system*, or standard costing, as a cost accounting system that uses cost units determined before production for estimating the cost of an order or product. For management control purposes, the standards are compared to actual costs, and variances are computed.

***Cost of goods sold (COGS)*:** An accounting classification useful for determining the amount of direct
materials, direct labor, and allocated overhead associated with the products sold during a given period
of time.
***Current price:*** The price currently being paid as opposed to standard cost. (A related term is market
price, which is the going price for an item on the open market.)
***Usage variance:*** Deviation of the actual consumption of materials as compared to the standard.
***Cost variance:*** In cost accounting, the difference between what has been budgeted for an activity and
what it actually costs.

Negative variances occur when costs are greater than expected; positive variances occur when costs are less than expected.

Overhead costs are allocated based on a cost driver. A cost driver is simply a measurable
aspect of an operation that is used to approximate how much of the overhead should be associated with the
units produced.

### Analysis of financial statements

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) developed by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as follows:
A common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and
comparable across international boundaries. As a result of growing international shareholding and
trade, they are rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which is comparable,
understandable, reliable, and relevant as per the users internal or external.

Statement of financial position at the end of the period >  balance sheet
Statement of comprehensive income for the period >  income statement
Statement of changes in equity for the period > statement of retained earnings
Statement of cash flows for the period > cash flows

**Assets.** A resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic
benefits are expected to flow to the entity.
**Liabilities.** A present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is
expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.
**Equity.** A residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.
**Income**. Increases in economic benefits that result in increases in equity (other than those related to
contributions from shareholders). Income includes both revenues (resulting from ordinary activities)
and gains.
**Expenses**. Decreases in economic benefits that result in decreases in equity (other than those related
to distributions to shareholders). Expenses include losses that are not the result of ordinary activities.

**balance sheet,** or statement of financial position, as “a financial statement showing the resources owned, the debts owed, and the owners’ share of a company at a given point in time.”

Assets = Liabilities + Owners Equity

**obsolescence** is 1) The condition of being out of date. A loss of value occasioned by new developments that place the
older property at a competitive disadvantage. A factor in depreciation. 2) A decrease in the value of an
asset brought about by the development of new and more economical methods, processes, or
machinery. 3) The loss of usefulness or worth of a product or facility as a result of the appearance of
better or more economical products, methods, or facilities.

**accounts receivable** are the value of goods shipped or services rendered to a customer on which payment has not yet been received. Usually includes an allowance for bad debts.

**Accounts payable** are “the value of goods and services acquired for which payment has not yet been
made.”

**income statement**, or statement of comprehensive income under IFRS terminology, as “a financial statement showing the net income for a business over a given period of time.”

Income = Revenue - Expenses

**Profit** is money remaining from revenues after deduction of certain expenses.
The **profit margin**, which measures the degree of financial success for a business, is “the difference
between the sales and cost of goods sold…sometimes expressed as a percentage of sales” 
The **gross [profit] margin** measures “the difference between total revenue and the cost of goods sold”
**Net profit** is figured by deducting all expenses, not only the cost of goods sold, from revenues.

### Statement of cash flows

statement of cash flows (funds flow statement) as “a financial statement showing the flow of cash and its timing into and out of an organization or project [over a given period of time].”

The most popular method of calculating a statement of cash flows is called the **indirect method**. With the
indirect method, the operating activities section will show net income (called after-tax net income in Exhibit 1-
23) from the income statement followed by a number of necessary adjustments to convert the total net
income to the cash impact of all business activities for the period.

**cash flow** is The net flow of dollars into or out of the proposed project [organization]. [It is] the algebraic sum, in any
time period, of all cash receipts, expenses, and investments.
