# Strategic Analysis Tools

### SWOT Analysis

SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats

Internal strengths and weaknesses are typically derived from comprehensive data collected about
the organization.

External opportunities and threats are based on market trends and risk analyses. Opportunities can be acted upon to help move an organization toward achieving its goals. However, if those opportunities are ignored or improperly developed, they can transform into threats (like IBM giving Bill Gates the green light to market his disk operating system [DOS] because they weren’t in the “software business”).

Threats are defined as risks that can impact a company negatively if they are not handled appropriately.

### Market research

#### Research

Marketing begins its quest to understand the marketplace by doing marketing research: “the systematic gathering, recording, and analyzing of data about problems relating to the marketing of goods and services.”

There are several types of marketing research:
**Market analysis:** the study of the size, location, nature, and characteristics of markets (for example,
product potential). 
**Sales analysis** (or research): the systematic study and comparison of sales (or consumption) data and
market share (“the actual portion of current market demand that a company or product achieves,”
**Consumer research:** the discovery and analysis of consumer attitudes, reactions, and preferences
(including motivation research).
