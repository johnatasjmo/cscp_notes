# Objectives

## Objectives include

- Improvement of market knowledge
- Implementing 3 Vs (increase velocity, increase visibility, reduce variability)
- Streamlining operations
- Improvement management of risk
- Increasing sustainability



### Improving Market knowledge

- most advantage to get info from partners
- purchase from survey companies or database marketing

### Implementing 3Vs

#### Increased visibility

- the ability to view important information in a facility or supply chain no matter where is located
- with actions prompted instantly and automatically, partners can save cost and time
- Better visibility has resulted in greater velocity

#### Increased velocity

- relative speed of all transactions collectively, within a supply chain community. High velocity -> high value turnover and faster oder-to-delivery response for customers
- more rapid modes of transportation
- reducing the time the inventory is not moving
- eliminating activities that do not add value
- speeding the flow of demand, cash and inventory

#### Reduced variability

- variability is the natural tendency to fluctuate above and below average value
- i.e: average time of completion, average number of defects, average daily sales
- SCM works to reduce variability in both supply and demand as much as possible

#### Additional Vs

- Vocalization: good communication between partners
- Variety: mix of products to meet customer demand
- Volume: amount of product changes to meet mass-customized demand

### Streamlining operations

Organization is good at:

- Identify partners
- Identify bottlenecks
- Identify and remove non added value activities
- Knowing who is responsible
- Identify interdependent processes

### Improving management of risk

- Keeps the supply chain flexible in case of disruptive events
- Risks are shared among partners
- Risk planning prepares employees and partners

### Increasing sustainability

- the need for economic activities to operate within limits imposed by natural resources
