# Supply chain models

a **supply chain** is a global network used to deliver products and services from raw materials to end customers through an engineered flow of information, physical distribution, and cash.



**supply chain management** is the design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronizing supply with demand, and measuring performance globally.

“entities” can be business or governmental organizations or individuals.

- Supply chain management is about creating net value.

- There should be value-creating activities in the supply chain (value for each stakeholder)

- Managing supply chains requires balancing competing interests

  

**Vertical integration**, or vertical supply chain management, refers to the practice of bringing the supply chain inside one organization.

**Lateral integration,** an organization specializes in its core competencies and relies on other specialists for the rest of the supply chain.

**keiretsu:** a  form of cooperative relationship among companies in Japan where the companies largely remain legally and economically independent, even though they work closely in various ways such as financial backing.

Reasons for lateral SC:

- To achieve economies of scale and scope.
- To improve business focus and expertise.
- To leverage communication and production competencies.

**service industry** is 1) In its narrowest sense, an organization that provides an intangible product (e.g., such as medical or legal advice). 2) In its broadest sense, all organizations except farming, mining, and manufacturing. Includes retail trade; wholesale trade; transportation and utilities; finance, insurance, and real estate; construction; professional, personal, and social services; and local, state, and federal governments.

### Specialized Supply Chains

**Service industries** are included in the category of specialized supply chains, as are humanitarian and disaster relief, nonprofits, and retailers. Other supply chains that might be considered specialized are  industry-specific, virtual or e-business, or small- or medium-size companies’ chains. Maintenance, repair, and operating supplies (MRO) (discussed in the “Inventory” section) might also be considered an example of a specialized supply chain but has become much more mainstream now.
